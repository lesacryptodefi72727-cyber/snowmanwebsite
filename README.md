# Helix Peptides — research peptides storefront

A fast, self-contained, **static** storefront modeled on echopeptides.co:
dark research-lab aesthetic, product catalog with COA badges, a working
client-side cart (saved in the browser), category filtering, and a
researcher/age-verification gate. No framework, no build step.

```
helix-peptides/
├─ index.html     ← all markup / sections
├─ styles.css     ← design system (colors, layout, responsive)
├─ app.js         ← catalog data + cart + gate + interactions
├─ netlify.toml   ← Netlify config (headers, no build)
└─ README.md      ← this file
```

## Deploy to Netlify

**Option A — drag & drop (fastest)**
1. Go to <https://app.netlify.com/drop>
2. Drag the whole **`helix-peptides`** folder onto the page.
3. Done — Netlify gives you a live URL. Rename the site in *Site settings → Change site name*.

**Option B — from Git (auto-deploys on every push)**
1. Push this folder to a GitHub repo.
2. In Netlify: *Add new site → Import from Git* → pick the repo.
3. Build command: *(leave empty)* · Publish directory: `.`

To use a custom domain, add it in *Domain settings* and point your DNS as Netlify instructs.

## Rebrand it (make it the client's store)

Everything is plain text — search & replace:

| Change | Where |
|---|---|
| Brand name | `app.js` → `BRAND`; `index.html` → "Helix Peptides" everywhere |
| Support email | `app.js` → `SUPPORT_EMAIL`; footer links in `index.html` |
| Logo | the inline `<svg>` helix marks in `index.html` (search `logo-mark`) |
| Colors | `styles.css` → `:root` variables (`--accent`, `--bg`, …) |
| Products / prices | `app.js` → `PRODUCTS` array |
| Address / legal | footer in `index.html` |
| Announcement bar | `.ticker` in `index.html` |

Add a product: copy one line in the `PRODUCTS` array and set
`id`, `name`, `cat` (`peptides` / `blends` / `bac`), `price`, `coa`
(`true` published · `false` pending · `null` not applicable) and `hue`
(0–360, tints the vial).

## Admin + checkout = your SnowmanBot Telegram bot

This site is the **shop window** for your existing **SnowmanBot**. It reads your
live published products from the bot and every **Order** button opens the bot,
where checkout + payment already happen (crypto / bank / Stars).

- **Before it's connected:** the site shows a built-in demo catalog (works out of
  the box — great for the first Netlify deploy).
- **After you set `API_BASE` + `TELEGRAM_BOT`** at the top of `app.js` and redeploy:
  the catalog shows your bot's real products and prices with photos.

Full setup — the small read-only API added to SnowmanBot, plus wiring the site —
is in **`CONNECT-TO-SNOWMANBOT.md`**.

> The separate `../helix-admin-bot` folder (a standalone Firestore admin bot) is an
> alternative and is **not needed** when you use SnowmanBot.

**Newsletter + contact — Netlify Forms (optional)**
Add `netlify` to the `<form>` tag (and a hidden `form-name` input) so Netlify
captures submissions — see <https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/>. Or point the
form `action` at a [Formspree](https://formspree.io) endpoint.

**COA downloads**
The `COA ↓` buttons are placeholders. Drop PDF files in a `/coa` folder and
link them from each product, or point them at your COA library.

## Compliance note

This template keeps the reference site's "for laboratory research use only"
framing, the researcher-verification gate, and the FDA disclaimer. Make sure
the final copy, claims, shipping, and payment setup match the laws that apply
to the client's business and their payment processor's rules before going live.
